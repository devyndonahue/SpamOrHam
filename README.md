Split the email data up into a training set and a test set

Used a logistic regression classifier and then tested the accuracy of the model to see if it was classifying the emails into correct categories.

To improve upon the accuracy, I added new features such as: amount of punctuation in the email, amount of upper case letters, amount of characters in each email, and amount of unique words used in each email.
